# World of Light

World of Light is the coursework project assignment of my Data Structures & Algorithms course, which is carried out in Spring 2019 at Tampere University.

## Project description

The project is done in 2 phases. Phase 1 requires the usage and implementation of C++ data structures (vectors, maps, unordered maps, linked lists, trees, etc.) and sorting algorithms. Phase 2 focuses on graphs and searching algorithms (Breadth-First search, Depth-First search, Dijkstra, etc.) 

Detailed descriptions of each phase can be found [here](https://github.com/vormium/worldOfLight/blob/master/Phase%201%20description.pdf) (phase 1) and  [here](https://github.com/vormium/worldOfLight/blob/master/Phase%202%20description.pdf) (phase 2).


## Compilation

The program should be compiled with Qt Creator in order to enable the GUI.
